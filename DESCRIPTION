Description: syntenet can be used to infer synteny networks from BLASTp-like
    tabular output and analyze them. Anchor pairs from synteny analyses are
    treated as an undirected unweighted graph (i.e., a synteny network),
    and users can perform: i. network clustering; ii. phylogenomic profiling 
    (by identifying which species contain which clusters) and; 
    iii. microsynteny-based phylogeny reconstruction with maximum likelihood.
