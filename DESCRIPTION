Description: syntenet can be used to infer synteny networks from 
    whole-genome protein sequences and analyze them. Anchor pairs
    are detected with the MCScanX algorithm, which was ported to this package
    with the Rcpp framework for R and C++ integration. 
    Anchor pairs from synteny analyses are
    treated as an undirected unweighted graph (i.e., a synteny network),
    and users can perform: i. network clustering; ii. phylogenomic profiling 
    (by identifying which species contain which clusters) and; 
    iii. microsynteny-based phylogeny reconstruction with maximum likelihood.
